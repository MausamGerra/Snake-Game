!!Snake Game!!
It is a typical snake game that everyone of us might have played in our childhood. The snake keeps to grow in length whenever it comes in contact with the food.
With each contact with food, the size of the snake keeps growing and so does the score.
If the snake comes in contact with it's own tail, then Game Over!
